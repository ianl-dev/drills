# Problem: Two sum
# Date: 11/5/2021
"""
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
"""

"""
My approach:
- Use hashmap
    - Go thru the list once, record the difference between target and element (e.g. 9-2 = 7)
    - Call this complement: Map difference to complement {7:0, 2:1}
- Loop
    - Go thru the list once more, check if current number's complement is in dictionary
        - e.g. [2,7,11], is current index 0 (num of 2) in {7:0, 2:1} -> yes, return [1,0]
My take-aways:
    - Use hashmap to store {signal: thing you want to find} such that when you have the correct signal you can pinpoint your goal

Simplify my language:
- the list -> list
- Go through all the numbers and check -> Visit each number and check
- something is Not None -> not(something is None) -> more pythonic

# My solution

    """
    Return a tuple of the indices of the pair of numbers that add up to target
    IN:
        nums (list) - a list of integers
        target (int) - two numbers add up to this
    OUT:
        pairIndex (tuple) - pair of elements that add up to target
